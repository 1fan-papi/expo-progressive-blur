# 🚀 Expo Progressive Blur

This component recreates the modern, layered **Apple-style translucent headers** you’ll find across iOS apps like **Settings**, **Wallet**, and **Music** now entirely in **React Native**

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Progressive Blur Header** uses:

- **`MaskedView`** → for applying a _gradient-based mask_ on top of the header background.
- **`BlurView` (expo-blur)** → to add real-time iOS-like material blur.
- **`react-native-reanimated`** → to animate the header opacity, scale, and intensity of blur as you scroll.
- **`expo-linear-gradient`** → for the dynamic light-to-dark transitions.
- **`easeGradient` (react-native-easing-gradient)** → for natural easing between color stops.

It’s designed to feel _native_ — blending the blurred background with subtle spring animations and masked gradients that progressively reveal the content below.

## 🖼️ Visual Concept

🌀 As you scroll down:

- The **large title** fades out.
- The **compact header** fades in with a **soft spring**.
- The **blur intensity** and **gradient opacity** increase progressively.
- The masked gradient reveals the _translucent material_ underneath, creating that signature _iOS floating glass_ effect.
